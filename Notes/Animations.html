            <h3>Transforms</h3>
            <p>We can manipulate an element’s appearance using transform functions. The value of the transform property
                is one or
                more transform functions (separated by spaces) that will be applied in the order they’re provided. <br>

                <b>Translation functions</b>allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down. <br>

                </b>Transforms and Older Browsers</br>, transforms require vendor prefixing for IE9, Android up to
                4.4.3, iOS8, and Blackberry 10. To make the aforementioned code work in IE9 and older mobile WebKit
                browsers, you would include the following:
            </p>
            <code>
                -webkit-transform: translate(45px,-45px); /* iOS8, Android 4.4.3, BB10 */ <br>
                -ms-transform: translate(45px,-45px); /* IE9 only */ <br>
                transform: translate(45px,-45px);
            </code>
            </h3>Scaling</h3>
            <p>
                The <code>scale(x,y)</code> function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then
                vertically. If only
                one value
                is provided, it will be used for both the x and y values, growing or shrinking your element or
                pseudo-element while
                maintaining the original aspect ratio. For example, scale(1) would leave the element the same
                size, scale(2) would
                double its proportions, scale(0.5) would halve them, and so on. Providing different values will distort
                the element, as
                you’d expect:
            </p>
            <code>
                transform: scale(1.5, 0.25);
            </code>
            <p>
                As with translate , you can also use the scaleX(x) or scaleY(y) functions. These functions will scale
                only the horizontal dimensions or only the vertical dimensions respectively. <br>
                To declare multiple transformations, provide a space-separated list of transform functions. We simply
                add our scale to the end of that space-separated list. <br>
                It’s also worth remembering that <b>scaling, like translation, has no impact on the document flow</b>.
            </p>
            <h3>Rotation</h3>
            The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value. As
            with scale , by default the point of origin is the element’s center. Generally, angles are declared in
            degrees, with positive degrees moving clockwise and negative moving counterclockwise. In addition to
            degrees, values can be provided in grads, radians, or turns, but we’ll just be sticking with degrees.


            <h3>Skew</h3>
            <p>
                The <code>skew(x,y)</code> function specifies a skew along the x and y axes. As you’d expect,
                the x specifies the skew
                on the x axis, and the y specifies the skew on the y axis. If the second parameter is omitted,
                the skew will only occur
                on the x axis:
            </p>
            <code>
                transform: skew(15deg, 4deg);
            </code>

            <p>The order of transform functions does matter: if you rotate before translating, your translate direction
                will be on the rotated axis. <br>

                The <b>transition-timing-function</b> lets you control the pace of the transition in even more granular
                detail.
            </p>
            <h3>Transition Delay Property</h3>
            <p>
                Finally, by using the transition-delay property, it’s possible to introduce a delay before the
                transition begins. Normally a transition begins immediately, so the default is 0 . Include the number of
                milliseconds ( ms ) or seconds ( s ) to delay the transition. We don’t want our transition to start
                immediately, because that might be a bad user experience if the user accidentally mouses through our ad
                on the way from one part of the document to the next. A 50ms delay is enough time to wait to be sure
                they are intentionally hovering over our advertisement:
            </p>
            <code>
                -webkit-transition-delay: 50ms;
                transition-delay: 50ms;
            </code>

            <h3>Canvas</h3>

            <p>With HTML5’s Canvas API, we can draw anything we can imagine, all through JavaScript. This can improve
                the
                performance of our websites by avoiding the need to download images off the network. With canvas, we can
                draw shapes and
                lines, arcs and text, gradients and patterns. In addition, canvas gives us the power to manipulate
                pixels in images and
                even video
            </p>

            <h3>SVG</h3>
            <p>
                SVG stands for <b>Scalable Vector Graphics</b>, a specific file format that allows you to describe
                vector graphics using XML. A major selling point of vector graphics in general is that, unlike bitmap
                images (such as GIF, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF), vector images preserve their quality even as you blow them up
                or shrink them down. We can use SVG to do many of the same tasks we can do with canvas, including
                drawing paths, shapes, text, gradients, and patterns.
