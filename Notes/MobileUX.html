            <h3>Remembering User's Info</h3>
            <p>Computers are stupid. For there to be true communication between the user and apps, it has to be
                bidirectional. <br>
                For techies, input and output are called IO. <br>
                The old white bearded guys named the tags in HTML. <br>
                Sections requires the full width of the page. <br>
                When you want to show something to a user, you use a section and the special word 'innerHTML'. <br>
                When you want to get some input, you use the special word 'value'. <br>
                LocalStorage saves key-value pairs data in a web browser. They have no expiration date, it is a
                read-only property.</p>

            <h3>Master Mobile UX</h3>
            <p>"If you design for the smallest, least powerful device first, then you will focus on the content, and
                your core functionality. That leads to simple, beautiful apps. If you do it the other way around, it'll
                be like trying to put a marshmallow into a piggy bank, which is neither simple nor beautiful." </p>
            <p> Joel Marsh - The Hipper Element</p>


            <h3>The Paradigm Shift </h3>
            <p> Mobile devices are being replaced way faster, and there are way more than desktop devices. <br>
                Responsive Retrofitting: Take what you have and make it responsive. </p>

            <h3>Mobile First </h3>
            <p> Design for the mobile view first. You are planning for the future. <br>
                There are a lot more mobile devices coming in the future </p>

            <h3>How to Improve Mobile UX </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Be There</li>
                <li>Be Useful</li>
                <li>Be Quick</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reachability Matters</h3>
            <p>Design in a way the user doesn't have to make an extra effort to reach what they need </p>

            <h3>Speed Matters</h3>
            <p> Optimize and minify CSS and JS files <br>
                GZIP files to eliminate unnecessary data <br></p>

            <h3>Make it simple so people can use it easily. </h3>
            <p>Learn how to enable autofill in the forms, learn how to show passwords, present keyboard needed <br>

                Before you advertise, research. <br>
                Stop using Pop-ups/Pop-overs <br></p>
