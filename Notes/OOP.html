            <h3>Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript</h3>
            <p>
                The static keyword can be used in class declarations to create a static method. A static method is
                called by the
                class directly rather than by instances of the class. <br>

                Creating an instance is to create an object with the class data. <br> <br>

                What is the difference of class declarations and constructor functions? <br>

                By default, an object’s methods are public in JavaScript. Methods and properties are said to be public
                because
                they can be queried directly and changed by assignment. The dynamic nature of the language means that an
                object’s properties and methods can be changed after it has been created. <br> <br>

                What is the prototype of the Object()? <br>

                Properties of objects in JavaScript are said to be enumerable or non-enumerable. If they aren’t
                enumerable, this
                means they will not show up when a for-in loop is used to loop through an object’s properties and
                methods. <br>

                The concept of polymorphism means that different objects can have the same method, but implement it in
                different
                ways. Polymorphism means that objects are able to override this method with a more specific
                implementation. <br> <br>

                A mixin is a way of adding properties and methods of some objects to another object without using
                inheritance.
                It allows more complex objects to be created by ‘mixing’ basic objects together. <br> <br>

                When objects are copied by assignment, they are only copied by reference. This means that another object
                is not
                actually created in memory; the new reference will just point to the old object. Any changes that are
                made to
                either objects will affect both of them. Arrays and functions are objects, so whenever they’re copied by
                assignment they will just point to the same object. And when one changes, they all change. This is known
                as
                making a shallow copy of an object. A deep or hard copy will create a completely new object that has all
                the
                same properties as the old object. The difference is that when a hard copy is changed, the original
                remains the
                same. But when a shallow copy is changed, the original changes too. <br>
