            <h3> This </h3>
            <p> Actions are represented in JavaScript by functions in properties. <br>
                To access the object, a method can use the this keyword.
                <b>'this'</b> represents the object. <br>
                The value of this is defined at run-time.
                <ul>
                    <li>When a function is declared, it may use this, but that this has no value until the function is
                        called.</li>
                    <li>A function can be copied between objects.</li>
                    <li>When a function is called in the “method” syntax: object.method(), the value of this during the
                        call is object.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Please note that arrow functions are special: they have no this. When this is accessed inside an arrow
                function, it is taken from outside.
            </p>


            <h3>Objects </h3>
            <p>
                An object in JavaScript is a self-contained set of related values and functions. They act as a
                collection of
                named properties that map to any JavaScript value such as strings, numbers, booleans, arrays and
                functions.
                If a property’s value is a function, it is known as a method. <br>

                All objects are mutable at any time when a program is running. This means that its properties and
                methods
                can be changed or removed, and new properties and methods can be added to the object, even if it was
                declared using const. <br>

                Objects Literals are declared:
            </p>

            <code>const object_name = {};</code>

            <p>
                <b>Computed properties</b>, this means that JavaScript code can be placed inside square brackets and the
                property key will be the return value of that code <br>

                <b>Object.key()</b> returns an array with all the keys of an object <br>
                <b>Object.value()</b> returns an array with all the values of an object <br>
                <b>Object.entries()</b> returns an array with all the key and values of an object <br>

                <b>The parse()</b> method takes a string of data in JSON format and returns a JavaScript object

                <b>The stringify()</b> method does the opposite, taking a JavaScript object and returning a string of
                JSON data, as can be seen in the example:

                <b>A regular expression</b> (or RegExp, for short) is a pattern that can be used to search strings for
                matches to the pattern.
            </p>
            <h3>The Document Object Model </h3>
            <p>
                The Document Object Model, or DOM for short, represents an HTML document as a network of connected nodes
                that form a tree-like structure. <br>
                The DOM treats everything as a node. <br>
                You can check the type of a node with nodeType: </p>
            <code>
                const body = document.body;
                body.nodeType;
                // 1
            </code>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Code</th>
                    <th>Type</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td>Element</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>2</td>
                    <td>Attribute</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>3</td>
                    <td>Text</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>8</td>
                    <td>Comment</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>9</td>
                    <td>Body</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>You can also find the name:</p>
            <code>
                body.nodeName; <br>
                //"BODY"
            </code>
            <p>
                When you get elements by id you are referencing that element, you have access to several functions, like
                appendChild. <br>
                This is because the idea of id's is that there should be unique. <br>

                You don't have for example the appendChild property on getElementsByClassName, this is because you are
                returning a live node list of all elements, which is not the same as referencing the element as with
                getElementById.
            </p>
            <h3>Query Selectors</h3>
            <p>
                The document.querySelector() method allows you to use CSS notation to find the first element in the
                document that matches a CSS selector provided as an argument. If no elements match, it will return null.
                <br>
                The document.querySelectorAll() method also uses CSS notation but returns a node list of all the
                elements in the document that match the CSS query selector. If no elements match, it will return an
                empty node list. <br>
                They are also very powerful because the will return the reference to the element as the getElementById
                does, but this time you can use any CSS property syntax to identify it. <br>
                There are also some properties like removeChild and replaceChild similar to what appendChild does
            </p>
            <h3>Updating CSS </h3>
            <p>
                You need to select the node and then use the . operator to access 'styles'. Inside there you can start
                making modifications. <br>
                Any CSS property names that are separated by dashes must be written in camelCase notation, so the dash
                is removed and the next letter is capitalized because dashes are not legal characters in property names.
            </p>
            <code>
                superman.style.backgroundColor = 'blue'; //superman is a node <br>
                // "blue"
            </code>
            <p>
                Or you can also use the bracket notation to select the CSS property:
            </p>
            <code>
                superman.style['background color'] = 'blue'; //bracket notaion used here
                // "blue"
            </code>
            <h3>Disappearing Act</h3>
            <p>
                One particularly useful CSS property often employed is the display property. This can be used to make
                elements disappear and reappear on the page as needed:
            </p>
            <code>
                superman.style.display = 'none';
                // "none"
            </code>
            <p>
                The element can be made to reappear by changing the display property back to block: </p>
            <code>
                superman.style.display = 'block';
                // "block"
            </code>
            <h3>Events</h3>
            <p>
                Events are another part of the DOM and they are what provides the link between the web page and user
                interactions. <br>

                You can place event listeners on your nodes that will fire the code to do something, an example would
                be:
            </p>
            <code>
                document.body.addEventListener("click", doSomething);
            </code>
            <p>
                The recommended way of dealing with events, and the current standard, is to use event listeners. <br>
                The addEventListener() method is called on a node object, the node to which the event listener is being
                applied. For example, this code will attach an event listener to the document’s body:
            </p>
            <code>
                document.body.addEventListener('click',doSomething);
            </code>
            <p>
                Whenever an event handler is triggered by an event, the callback function is called. This function is
                automatically passed an event object as a parameter that contains information about the event. <br>
