            <h3>Testing and Debugging</h3>
            <p>Errors and bugs are a fact of life in programming - they will always be there.</p>

            <h3>Errors</h3>
            <p>
                Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program. They are usually caused by one of the
                following:
                <ul>
                    <li>System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is
                        interacting.</li>
                    <li>Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as
                        simple
                        as a
                        typo.</li>
                    <li>User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle</li>
                </ul>

                Programmer errors are our responsibility, so we must ensure they are minimized as much as possible and
                fixed
                promptly. We also should try to limit user errors by predicting any possible interactions that may throw
                an
                error, and ensure they are dealt with in a way that doesn’t negatively affect the user experience. <br>

                An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with
                the
                error. For example, trying to call a method that is nonexistent will result in a reference error that
                raises an
                exception. <br>

                An exception will also produce a stack trace. This is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead
                to the
                point where the error occurred. </p>

            <h3>Warnings</h3>
            <p>A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn’t enough to cause the program to crash.</p>

            <h3>Strict Mode</h3>
            </p>
            ECMAScript 5 introduced a strict mode that produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of
            some
            deprecated features. This is due to the fact that strict mode considers coding practices that were
            previously
            accepted as just being “poor style” as actual errors. <br>

            To start using strict mode you just have to add
            </p>
            <code>'use strict';</code>
            <p>
                This will be picked up by any JavaScript engine that uses strict mode. If the engine does not support
                strict
                mode, this string will simply be ignored.
            </p>
            <h3>Error Objects</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>RangeError</b> is thrown when a number is outside an allowable range of values.</li>
                <li><b>ReferenceError</b> is thrown when a reference is made to an item that doesn’t exist. For example,
                    calling a
                    function that hasn’t been defined.</li>
                <li><b>SyntaxError</b> is thrown when there’s an error in the code’s syntax.</li>
                <li><b>TypeError</b> is thrown when there’s an error in the type of value used; for example, a string is
                    used when a number is expected.</li>
                <li><b>URIError</b> is thrown when there’s a problem encoding or decoding the URI.</li>
                <li><b>InternalError</b> is a non-standard error that is thrown when an error occurs in the JavaScript
                    engine. A common cause of this is too much recursion.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Tests</h3>
            <p>
                Testing is an important part of programming that can often be overlooked. Writing good tests means your
                code
                will be less brittle as it develops, and any errors will be identified early on. <br>

                Test-driven development(TDD) is the process of writing tests before any actual code. Obviously these
                tests will
                initially fail, because there is no code to test. The next step is to write some code to make the tests
                pass.
                After this, the code is refactored to make it faster, more readable, and remove any repetition. The code
                is
                continually tested at each stage to make sure it continues to work. This process should be followed in
                small
                piecemeal chunks every time a new feature is implemented, resulting in the following workflow:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Write tests (that initially fail)</li>
                <li>Write code to pass the tests</li>
                <li>Refactor the code</li>
                <li>Test refactored code</li>
                <li>Write more tests for new features</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
    </main>
</body>
