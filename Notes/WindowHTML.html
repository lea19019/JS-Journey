            <h3>The Window Object</h3>
            <p>
                Every JavaScript environment has a global object. Any variables that are created in the global scope are
                actually properties of this object, and any functions are methods of it. In a browser environment the
                global
                object is the window object, which represents the browser window that contains a web page.
            </p>

            <h3>The Browser Object Model</h3>
            <p>
                The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain
                information
                about the browser and computer screen. For example, we can find out which browser is being used to view
                a
                page
                (though, this method is unreliable). We can also find out the dimensions of the screen it is viewed on,
                and
                which pages have been visited before the current page. It can also be used for the rather dubious
                practice
                of
                creating pop-up windows, if you’re into annoying your users.
            </p>
            <h3>Browser Information</h3>
            <p>
                The window object has a navigator property that returns a reference to the Navigator object. The
                Navigator
                object contains information about the browser being used. Its userAgent property will return information
                about
                the browser and operating system being used.</p>
            <code>
                window.navigator.userAgent
            </code>

            <h3>The Browser History</h3>
            <p>
                The window.history property can be used to access information about any previously visited pages in the
                current browser session. <br>
                The window.history.length property shows how many pages have been visited before arriving at the current
                page. <br>
                The window.history.go() method can be used to go to a specific page, where 0 is the current page:
            </p>
            <code>
                window.history.go(1); // goes forward 1 page <br>
                window.history.go(0); // reloads the current page <br>
                window.history.go(-1); // goes back 1 page <br>
            </code>
            <p>
                There are also the window.history.forward() and window.history.back() methods that can be used to
                navigate
                forwards and backwards by one page respectively, just like using the browser’s forward and back buttons.
            </p>
            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>
                Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user’s computer. They were invented by Netscape as a
                way
                of
                getting round HTTP being a stateless protocol. This means that a browser does not remember anything from
                one
                request to another. So every time a user visits a page, nothing about any previous visits is remembered.
                Cookies
                can be used to sidestep this problem by storing information that can then be retrieved between requests.
            </p>

            <h3>The data- Attribute</h3>
            <p>
                The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by
                the
                browser. They’re also private to a page, so are not intended to be used by an external service – their
                sole
                purpose is to be used by a JavaScript program. This means they’re perfect for adding data that can be
                used
                as a
                hook that the program utilizes to access information about a particular element on the page.
            </p>
            <h3>Geolocation</h3>
            <p>
                The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device. This means it can be used
                to
                find
                the user’s exact location, then link to nearby places or measure the speed at which the user is moving.
                This
                information can then be used to filter data based on the user’s location or speed and direction of
                travel.
                An
                example of this might be a search function that returns results based on your location. Because of
                privacy
                concerns, permission to use this has to be granted by the user first.
            </p>
            <h3>Web Workers</h3>
            <p>
                We saw in earlier chapters that JavaScript is a single-threaded language, meaning that only one process
                can
                run
                at one time. Web workers allow processes to be run in the background, adding support for concurrency in
                JavaScript. The idea is that any processes that could take a long time are carried out in the
                background, so
                a
                website will continue to function without fear of the dreaded 'script has become unresponsive' message
                that
                occurs when a script runs for too long, shown below.

                Web workers allow computationally complex operations to be performed in a separate thread, meaning that
                the
                flow
                of a program won’t suffer interruptions, and an application will not freeze or hang. They are a useful
                feature
                that help to keep sites responsive, even when complicated operations are being carried out.
            </p>
            <h3>Websockets</h3>
            <p>
                Websocket is a new protocol that allows two-way communication with a server – also known as push
                messaging.
                This
                means that a connection is kept open and responses are ‘pushed’ to the client as soon as they are
                received.
