# JS Journey Overview

It was around January 2020 when I had my first contact with JavaScript, I wrote several exercises to helped me undestand general Programming concepts
such as for loops, data types, logical operators, etc. I remember thinking JS was a lot easier than C++ (which was the firs language I was learned), but 
due to my curriculum I sttoped my JS learning on those months. It wasn't until April of 2021 I continued my journey learning this wonderful language, this
repository contains notes, projects and examples I wrote during my JS journey. Hopefully you can find something useful here! üòÅ

# Web Pages

As part of my journey I created two SPA (Single Page Apps) with just JavaSript.

The first one is a To Do App that will allow the user to create, read, update and delete tasks with the help of local storage.

The second one is Country Mania which is build following the MVC architecture, I created its own repository and you'll find the link here too.
